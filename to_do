Load-Listings.ps1 - Dev Notes / TODO
====================================

STRUCTURE & CLEANUP
-------------------
- Break things up into reusable functions or modules, it’s getting long.
- Consider using param() for future flexibility (custom paths, debug flag, etc).
- Add comment-based help block so it shows usage when needed.

CODE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------
- Clean up indentation and spacing, make it consistent (4 spaces maybe).
- Cut down on repeated code — logging especially.
- Group config vars into a hashtable or object to tidy things up.

LOGIC & FLOW
------------
- Before backing up/importing MXF, do a sanity check (e.g., file exists and isn’t 0 bytes).
- Better pip package checking — maybe smarter comparison or caching.
- Handle machines with multiple Python installs more cleanly.

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
- Wrap risky spots with more specific try/catch blocks.
- Use `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` in spots where fails should bail out.
- Add fallback in case $logFile can’t be written (e.g., write to temp or just console).

DEBUGGING / TESTING
-------------------
- Add `-Verbose` or `-Debug` flag for extra output or timing info.
- Optional "dry run" mode — log actions without doing them.

LOGGING & FILE MGMT
-------------------
- Rotate or timestamp logs so the current one doesn’t get huge.
- Log full `loadmxf.exe` command for troubleshooting.
- Consider basic checksum or hash of MXF before/after.

PERF & MAINTENANCE
------------------
- Backup cleanup might be slow with lots of files — maybe parallel it later.
- Use `--disable-pip-version-check` and `--quiet` to speed up pip freeze/install.
- Rename `venv` to `.venv` just to follow modern naming standards.

Misc
----
- Maybe move colors out to constants or a config block to standardize.
